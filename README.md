# Knowledge-Distillation-for-Discriminator-in-SRGAN

A TensorFlow implementation of the paper "A Study of Lightening SRGAN Using Knowledge Distillation".  
This code is built on [super-resolution](https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution.git). Thanks to the author for sharing the codes.

### Dataset
I use DIV2K dataset as a training set and use four benchmark datasets (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100).  
You can download these datasets from [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) and [benchmarks](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/benchmark.tar).

### Usage
```
python
```
